Me and my friend Anna Zetterstr√∂m are huge Harry Potter fans and we really went all in on trying to bring some magic to this site.

This was the first project that we used animations and it was super fun.

We used localstorage to store data about the customers order between the the pages. 

OBS! The password is "i solemnly swear that i am up to no good". No muggles in the shop please.
