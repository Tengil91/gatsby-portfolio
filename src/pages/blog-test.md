I'm heading out to my internship at Quickchannel toworrow and I thought that I would post my experiences here. The purpose of the blog is to make it easier to recall what I've been working with and what I've learned.

Annother reason that I wanted to start this blog is that when I write about things that I don't quite understand it helps me to actually learn about it. On that note; here is a random post about the brain.

##The performers and the audiens that is the mind

My current understanding of the mind is that it can be divided in two groups: preformers and audiens. The audiens is listening, observing and feeling what is going on around us. They also watch the actors who are our thoughts and feelings. When we are present, calm and taking in the suroundings most of the minds population is part of the audition. When we are under a lot of stress or lost in thoughts a lot of the minds population becomes actors, trying to convince the audience that they need to act. Less of the audiens watches what is really going on and they get taken in by the play. 

To counter this we shift the focus from the play to reality. The play goes on and the audience watches it but if they realice that the play is just that, a play. When the actors realice that they are not convincing the audiens more of them sits down to watch.

The audiens is the part of the brain that is resting when we are in a calm enviorment. If more of them are actors we can't recover as much energy when we rest.

##When are the actors usefull?

This last part I'm stil trying to figure out but here are my thought: The actors are motivating us to do stuff. They are good for predictions. Mostly they come in the way when we actually do stuff. Less of the brain works on the task at hand and on top of it's getting distracted. But when we are in the planing phase the actors can show a us a play that can be very usefull.

Also: There never really seems to be a reason for the actors to be many. I think that this might happen when we ignore someting that is actually a important problem (like when we don't get enough rest). The audiens also tries to show us what is happening. Listening to the bodys signals is important.
